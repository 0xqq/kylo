The latest generation of Pipeline Controller represents a major revision to our Data Lake 
assets.  Some features:

    * Apache NiFi engine (vs. Spring Batch)
    * Apache Spark for data ingest processing  
    * Additional UI module oriented to Data Lake users
    * Users can create "data feeds" through our UI (no-code!)
    * Powerful ingest pipeline template that implements Think Big best practices
