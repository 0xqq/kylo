    <!-- Note that prior to Kylo 0.6 this file's name is the required file name of a 
         plugin context XML file.
         
         This file name has been deprecated (although it still works) in favor of the
         name "plugin-context.xml" to make it clear what its purpose is.  This file
         is purposely left empty.  But if your plugin is to be deployed to a Kylo version
         earlier than 0.6 then you should use this file name instead of plugin-context.xml -->
